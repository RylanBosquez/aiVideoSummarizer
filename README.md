# aiVideoSummarizer

`aiVideoSummarizer` is a local-first tool that takes a video link, extracts the transcript, and generates concise summaries using a local LLM. The pipeline is designed for privacy, reproducibility, and flexibility, making it useful for research, note-taking, or quickly understanding long-form content.

## Features

* **Transcript Extraction**: Fetches transcripts from supported video sources (YouTube, Vimeo).
* **Chunking**: Splits transcripts into manageable segments for processing without context loss.
* **Local LLM Integration**: Summarizes text using a local model via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/).
* **Customizable Output**: Summaries can be short abstracts, detailed notes, or structured outlines.
* **Privacy First**: No data is sent to external APIs unless configured by the user.
